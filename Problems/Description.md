# Question 1

## Check AB

### Suppose you have a string, S, made up of only 'a's and 'b's. Write a recursive program that checks if the string was generated using the following rules:

**b. Each 'a' is followed by nothing or an 'a' or "bb"**<br>
**c. Each "bb" is followed by nothing or an 'a'**<br>

**If all the rules are followed by the given string, return true otherwise return false.**

 # Question 2
 
## Black Square

### Quite recently, a very smart student named Jury decided that lectures are boring, so he downloaded a game called "Black Square" on his super cool touchscreen phone. 

**In this game, the phone's screen is divided into four vertical strips. Each second, a black square appears on some of the strips. According to the rules of the game, Jury must use this second to touch the corresponding strip to make the square go away. As Jury is both smart and lazy, he counted that he wastes exactly ai calories on touching the i-th strip.**

**You've got a string s, describing the process of the game and numbers a1, a2, a3, a4. Calculate how many calories Jury needs to destroy all the squares?**

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Input format :**

The first line contains four space-separated integers a1, a2, a3, a4 (0 ≤ a1, a2, a3, a4 ≤ 104).

The second line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), where the і-th character of the string equals "1", if on the i-th second of the game the square appears on the first strip, "2", if it appears on the second strip, "3", if it appears on the third strip, "4", if it appears on the fourth strip.

**Output format :**

Print a single integer — the total number of calories that Jury wastes.

# Question 3

### There are N cities in Chefland numbered from 1 to N and every city has a railway station. Some cities have a train and each city has at most one train originating from it. 

**The trains are represented by an array A, where Ai=0 means the i-th city doesn't have any train originating from it, Ai=1 means the train originating from the i-th city is moving right (to a higher numbered city), and Ai=2 means the train originating from the i-th city is moving left (to a lower numbered city).**

**Each train keeps on going forever in its direction and takes 1 minute to travel from the current station to the next one. There is a special station at city 1 which lets travellers instantaneously teleport to any other station that currently has a train. Teleportation and getting on a train once in the city both take 0 minutes and all trains start at time 0.**

**There are M travellers at city 1, and the i-th traveller has destination city Bi. They ask Chef to guide them to teleport to a particular station from which they can catch a train to go to their destination in the least time possible. In case it's not possible for a person to reach his destination, print −1.**

# Question 5

## Maximum Weaving Number

**Given two numbers A=a1a2...an and B= b1b2...Bm, we can weave these two numbers to produce the following numbers.**

**a1b1a2b2...anbnb(n+1)...bm,, if m>n<br>
a1b1a2b2...ambma(m+1)...an if m<n<br>
a1b1a2b2...anbn if m=n.<br>
Similarly, we can also get b1a1b2a2.... as above.**

**We can also start weaving from the end. By weaving from the end, we can form the words: anbnb(n-1)a(n-1)... , bnanb(n-1)a(n-1)...<br>
Thus, by weaving A and B, four new numbers are formed: weaving from the beginning, starting with A, weaving from the beginning, starting with B, weaving from the end, starting with A, weaving from the end, starting with B. While weaving two numbers A and B, if all the digits of A are weaved and some more digits are there in B, the remaining digits of B are just appended at the end.** 

**For example, if A = 27 and B = 54 then there are four numbers that can be woven<br>
2574<br>
5247<br>
7425<br>
4752<br>
and maximum out of these is 7425<br>
Given two numbers A and B, write a code to compute the numbers woven by A &B and find the maximum woven number.**

**Input format :**

First line contains the number A<br>
Next line contains the number B

**Output format :**

Print the maximum woven number

# Question 7

### Most problems in cp highlight coders love for food and cooking but little is known about his love for racing sports. 

**He is an avid Formula 1 fan. He went to watch this year's Indian Grand Prix at New Delhi. He noticed that one segment of the circuit was a long straight road. It was impossible for a car to overtake other cars on this segment. Therefore, a car had to lower down its speed if there was a slower car in front of it. While watching the race, Chef started to wonder how many cars were moving at their maximum speed.**

**Formally, you're given the maximum speed of N cars in the order they entered the long straight segment of the circuit. Each car prefers to move at its maximum speed. If that's not possible because of the front car being slow, it might have to lower its speed. It still moves at the fastest possible speed while avoiding any collisions. For the purpose of this problem, you can assume that the straight segment is infinitely long.**

**Count the number of cars which were moving at their maximum speed on the straight segment.**
